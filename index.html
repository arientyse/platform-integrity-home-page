					<li>It is required that your GitHub profile has your CareerBuilder email address.</li>
					<li>It is required that you are an active employee.</li>

			<p>This website provides a way to glance at how well CareerBuilder is doing with its performance on its products. We show and alert when when we go below threshold. We also show the duration of common paths in each product (e.g login on the US website).</p>

		<h4>Datastore</h4>
			<p>Data store is a tracking tool used to track the activity of recruiters to help satisfy government audits. The tool collects data, which can used to generate a report for any given time frame and account. </p>
			<p>The government program that runs this is called OFCCP. (Click <a href="https://www.dol.gov/ofccp/">here</a> for more information about OFCCP.)</p>
			<p>To generate a report, click <a href="http://buzz.careerbuilder.com/Resume/Resume/RDBDataStoreReport.aspx">here</a>.</p>

		<h4>Source Control</h4>
			<p>We manage the source control systems for most of CareerBuilder.</p>
			<p>This is TFS for the matrix code (<a href="http://tfs.careerbuilder.com:8080/tfs/web">http://tfs.careerbuilder.com:8080/tfs/web</a>) and GitHub for newer off-matrix code (<a href="https://github.com/cbdr">https://github.com/cbdr</a>).</p>
